      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8">
        MemeX is not just another token project — it's the next generation Web3 trading card game, built for the community, by the community.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Our vision is to create a self-sustaining game ecosystem where the community holds the majority of the token supply. This enables a fair and transparent economic model that supports long-term growth and real value for all players.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The game will feature a competitive PvP leaderboard system and a range of exciting PvE missions — designed for collectors, casuals and hardcore strategists alike. Players will be able to upgrade, fuse, and trade NFT cards directly in our future marketplace.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Regular content updates, new characters, meme-inspired worlds, and seasonal events will keep the Duelverse alive and evolving. Our ultimate goal is to bring the world of memes to life in a truly interactive, gamified experience.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-purple-400 font-semibold mt-10">
        This is more than a game — it’s a movement. Welcome to the MemeX Duelverse.
